# ✅ Build Errors Fixed - Summary

## 🐛 Issues That Were Resolved

### 1. **API Route Cookie Handling Error**
**Problem**: Next.js 15 requires proper async handling of cookies
```
Error: Route "/api/courses" used `cookies().get()` without awaiting
```

**Solution**: Updated `/app/api/courses/route.ts`:
```typescript
// Before (Error)
const supabase = createRouteHandlerClient({ cookies })

// After (Fixed) 
const cookieStore = cookies()
const supabase = createRouteHandlerClient({ cookies: () => cookieStore })
```

### 2. **Unused Imports in courses-client.tsx**
**Problem**: ESLint errors for unused imports
```
Error: 'Image' is defined but never used
Error: 'Star' is defined but never used
```

**Solution**: Removed unused imports:
```typescript
// Removed: Image, Star
import { BookOpen, Users, Calendar, Clock, ArrowRight } from "lucide-react"
```

### 3. **Unused Variables and Parameters**
**Problem**: TypeScript/ESLint errors for unused code
```
Error: 'request' is defined but never used (API route)
Error: 'enrollmentStatus' is assigned a value but never used
```

**Solution**: 
- Removed unused `request` parameter from API route
- Removed unused global `enrollmentStatus` state
- Removed unused `checkEnrollmentStatus` function

### 4. **Cleanup of Legacy Code**
**Problem**: Leftover code from refactoring
- Removed global enrollment status logic (replaced with per-course status)
- Cleaned up unused state management
- Simplified component dependencies

## ✅ Build Status: SUCCESSFUL

```

## ⚠️ Remaining Warnings
The build shows only minor warnings in other components:
- React Hook dependency warnings (not related to our changes)
- Supabase realtime dependency warnings (external library)
- Metadata base warnings (cosmetic, doesn't affect functionality)

These warnings don't affect the functionality of our course browsing feature.
