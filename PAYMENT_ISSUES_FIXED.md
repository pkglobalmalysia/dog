# Payment System Issues - FIXED ‚úÖ

## Issues Resolved

### 1. ‚úÖ Missing "View Receipt" Button
**Problem:** Admin interface only showed "Approve", "Reject", and "Delete" buttons, but no way to view the receipt image that students uploaded.

**Solution:** Added "View Receipt" button with eye icon that opens receipt images in a new tab.

**Implementation:**
- Added `handleViewReceipt()` function to open receipt URLs
- Added Eye icon button to both payment display sections
- Button only appears when `receipt_url` exists
- Opens receipt in new browser tab for easy viewing

### 2. ‚úÖ Payment Approval API Error
**Problem:** When admin clicked "Approve" payment, got error: "Failed to approve payment"

**Root Cause:** API was trying to query `courses_enhanced` table which doesn't exist.

**Solution:** Fixed API to query the correct `courses` table.

**Fixed Code:**
```typescript
// Before (causing error):
course:courses_enhanced!student_payments_course_id_fkey(title)

// After (working):
course:courses!student_payments_course_id_fkey(title)
```

### 3. ‚úÖ Missing Course ID Column
**Problem:** Student payment form was trying to submit `course_id` but database table didn't have this column.

**Solution:** 
- Created SQL script to add `course_id` column to `student_payments` table
- Added proper foreign key relationship to `courses` table
- Updated APIs to handle course information properly
