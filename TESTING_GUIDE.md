```javascript
adminEmail: 'your-admin@email.com',     // ⚠️ UPDATE THIS
adminPassword: 'your-admin-password',   // ⚠️ UPDATE THIS
```

### Step 2: Start Your Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Run the Tests

npm run test:student-mgmt
```

## 📊 What You'll Get

The tests will:
- 🖥️ Open a browser window (you can watch the tests run)

- 💡 Provide recommendations for any failures

### Output Files:
- `test-report.html` - Beautiful HTML report (open in browser)
- `test-results.json` - Raw test data
- `test-screenshots/` - Screenshots of each test step

## 🔧 Test Configuration

You can modify test behavior in `test-student-management-simple.js`:

```javascript
const TEST_CONFIG = {
    baseUrl: 'http://localhost:3000',  // Your app URL
    headless: false,                   // Set true to hide browser
    slowMo: 300,                      // Speed of actions (ms)
    timeout: 30000,                   // Test timeout
    screenshots: true,                // Take screenshots
};
```

## 🎯 Expected Results

After the database updates, you should see:

- ✅ **Courses API** returning courses with prices
- ✅ **Admin login** working with your credentials  
- ✅ **Course dropdown** populated with course options
- ✅ **Payment system** ready for manual payments

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### If tests fail:

1. **"Development server not running"**

2. **"Login failed"**
   - Update admin credentials in the test file
   - Verify admin user exists in your database

3. **"Courses API failed"**
