- [ ] **Expected:** No empty `{}` error objects
- [ ] **Expected:** Meaningful error messages if issues occur
- [ ] **Expected:** Graceful fallback when assignment_submissions table missing

### 7. Rate Limiting Prevention
- [ ] Try logging in multiple times quickly
- [ ] **Expected:** No "Rate limit reached" errors from auth provider
- [ ] **Expected:** Proper cooldown messages if rate limited by Supabase

## Console Log Verification

### 8. Auth Provider Logs
- [ ] Check browser console during login
- [ ] **Expected:** Single auth initialization
- [ ] **Expected:** No infinite loops of auth requests
- [ ] **Expected:** Clean auth state changes

### 9. Database Query Logs
- [ ] Check browser console on student pages
- [ ] **Expected:** Fallback queries when primary queries fail
- [ ] **Expected:** Helpful debug information
- [ ] **Expected:** No undefined/null errors

## API Endpoint Tests

### 10. Database Status
- [ ] Visit http://localhost:3000/api/test-db
- [ ] **Expected:** JSON response showing table status
- [ ] **Expected:** Clear indication of which tables exist

### 11. Assignment Submission API
- [ ] Test assignment submission through fallback API
- [ ] **Expected:** Proper error handling
- [ ] **Expected:** Fallback storage if main table missing

## Admin Database Setup (Optional)

### 12. Database Setup Tools
- [ ] Login as admin and visit http://localhost:3000/dashboard/admin/database-setup
- [ ] **Expected:** SQL commands provided to create missing tables
- [ ] **Expected:** Clear instructions for database setup

## Test Results Summary

### ‚úÖ Working Features:
- [ ] Login without rate limiting
- [ ] Student pages load successfully  
- [ ] Error messages are meaningful
- [ ] Fallback mechanisms work
- [ ] Console logs are clean

### ‚ùå Issues Found:
- [ ] List any remaining issues
- [ ] Note specific error messages
- [ ] Document workarounds needed

### üîß Recommended Fixes:
- [ ] Create assignment_submissions table in Supabase
- [ ] Add any missing RLS policies
- [ ] Update any remaining error handling

## Quick Test Commands

```bash
# Test database connectivity
curl http://localhost:3000/api/test-db

# Test assignment submission API
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/submit-assignment \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"assignment_id":"test","submission_text":"test"}'
```

## Expected Behavior Summary

The student should now be able to:
1. ‚úÖ Login without rate limit errors
2. ‚úÖ View their courses and assignments 
3. ‚úÖ Get meaningful error messages instead of `{}`
4. ‚úÖ Use fallback submission methods when needed
5. ‚úÖ Experience graceful degradation when tables missing

The fixes ensure the app works even with incomplete database setup while providing clear paths to resolution.
